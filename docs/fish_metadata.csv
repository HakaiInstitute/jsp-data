Full work-up 2: procedure for all samples effective Oct. 2017 (One RNA sample each taken from muscle, gill, brain, spleen, liver, heart, and head kidney; fatty acid, stable isotope, EXTRA MUSCLE STORED AT -80, DNA (if no fin clips were taken in the field), stomach, otolith, and scales). Full work-up 3: procedure for fish subsampled for compound specific stable isotope analysis (by David Costalago, Feb. 2018). All samples taken as in full work-up 2, with the addition of a second isotope sample taken. Work-up excluding cold samples: full work-up 1 without RNA, fatty acid, or stable isotope samples taken. Irregular work-up: processing with at least one sample type not taken (e.g. no RNA, no DNA, etc.). Lice enumeration only - in lab: fish was inspected for sea lice only and did not undergo dissection. Lengths and weight recorded. -20 work up 1: procedure for dissecting fish that have been previously stored at -20 before dissection. No RNA samples, no fatty acid samples, no extra muscle sample, no sea-lice retention. Reduced sterilization between fish to scrubbing and ethanoling direct contact surfaces with 95% ethanol.
