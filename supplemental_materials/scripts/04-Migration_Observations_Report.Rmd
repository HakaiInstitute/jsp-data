# Abstract 

The Hakai Institute Juvenile Salmon Program has been monitoring juvenile salmon migrations in the Discovery Islands and Johnstone Strait in British Columbia, Canada since 2015 with the specific purpose to understand how ocean conditions experienced by juvenile salmon during their early marine migration impact their growth, health, and ultimately survival. This report summarizes migration timing, purse seine catch intensity and composition, fish length and weight, sea-louse loads, and ocean temperatures observed from `r project_years` years of this research and monitoring program. Migration timing for sockeye, pink, and chum was not significantly different than respective time-series averages and occurred on `r f(so_q2_DI_current)` for sockeye, `r f(cu_q2_DI_current)` for chum, and on `r f(pi_q2_DI_current)` for pink salmon. In order of highest to smallest catch proportion seines were dominated by juvenile `r current_prop[[1,2]]`, `r current_prop[[2,2]]`, and `r current_prop[[3,2]]` salmon. Catch intensity (our relative abundance measurement) for chum was the lowest on record in the time series, though sockeye and chum catch intensity was nearer their time series averages. Mean annual fork length for sockeye, pink, and chum salmon were all shorter than the time series average. The abundance of pre-adult and adult _Caligus clemensi_ sea lice was relatively high on juvenile sockeye, pink, and chum salmon in 2020 compared to previous years. The salmonid-specialist sea louse, _Lepeophtheirus salmonis_, had relatively high abundance on pink and chum salmon but low abundance on sockeye. May--June 30 m depth integrated ocean temperature in the northern Strait of Georgia in `r current_year` was `r round(sst_stats_table$estimate, 2)` °C `r ifelse(sst_stats_table$estimate > 0, "warmer",  "colder")` than average for the time series (`r study_range`), the warmest we've observed in our time-series.

# Results

## Migration Timing
Sockeye:  `r f(so_q2_DI_current)`, `r round(so_timing_diff)` days `r so_later_or_earlier` than the time series average of `r f(so_q2_DI_TSA)`.
Pink:  `r f(pi_q2_DI_current)`, `r round(pi_timing_diff)` days `r pi_later_or_earlier` than the average of `r f(pi_q2_DI_TSA)`. 
Chum: `r f(cu_q2_DI_current)`, `r round(cu_timing_diff)` day `r cu_later_or_earlier` than the average of `r f(cu_q2_DI_TSA)`. 


## Catch intensity 

Sockeye: `r so_ci` 

Pink: `r  pi_ci` 

chum: `r cu_ci` 

## Catch proportion

Catch proportion was dominated by `r current_prop[[1,2]]` with `r round(current_prop[[1,4]] * 100, 1)`% of the catch.

Second highest catch proportion was `r current_prop[[2,2]]` salmon at `r round(current_prop[[2,4]] * 100, 1)`%.

Third highest was `r current_prop[[3,2]]` salmon at `r round(current_prop[[3,4]] * 100, 1)`% 

## Lengths

Sockeye length in `r current_year` was `r round(len_tt[1,3],1)` mm which compared to the time series average of `r round(len_tt[1,4],1)` mm results in a `r ifelse(len_tt$p.value[1] <  0.05, paste("statistically significant"), paste("statistically insignificant"))` difference of `r round(len_tt[1,2],1)`   mm (_p_ = `r round(len_tt$p.value[1],2)`, 95% CI `r round(len_tt$conf.low[1],1)`--`r round(len_tt$conf.high[1],1)` mm). 

Average pink lengths in `r current_year` was `r round(len_tt[2,3],1)` mm which compared to the time series average of `r round(len_tt[2,4],1)` mm results in a `r ifelse(len_tt$p.value[2] <  0.05, paste("statistically significant"), paste("statistically insignificant"))` difference of `r round(len_tt[2,2],1)`   mm (_p_ = `r round(len_tt$p.value[2],2)`, 95% CI `r round(len_tt$conf.low[2],1)`--`r round(len_tt$conf.high[2],1)` mm). 

Average chum lengths in `r current_year` was `r round(len_tt[3,3],1)` mm which compared to the time series average of `r round(len_tt[3,4],1)` mm results in a `r ifelse(len_tt$p.value[3] <  0.05, paste("statistically significant"), paste("statistically insignificant"))` difference of `r round(len_tt[3,2],1)`   mm (_p_ = `r round(len_tt$p.value[3],2)`, 95% CI `r round(len_tt$conf.low[3],1)`--`r round(len_tt$conf.high[3],1)` mm). 

## Sea lice

Sockeye salmnoh had an average of `r so_cal` _C. clemensi_ per fish and `r so_lep` _L. salmonis_ per fish.

Chum salmon had `r cu_cal`  _Caligus clemensi_ per fish and `r cu_lep` _Lepeophtheirus salmonis_ per fish.  

Pink salmon had `r pi_cal`  _C. clemensi_ per fish, and `r  pi_lep`  _L. salmonis_ per fish. 

## Ocean temps

Ocean temperature in the top 30 m of the water column in May and June during the juvenile salmon out-migration at QU39 in the northern Strait of Georgia was  `r round(sst_stats_table[1,2],1)` °C, `r round(sst_stats_table$estimate, 2)` `r ifelse(sst_stats_table$estimate > 0,  paste("warmer"), paste("colder"))` °C than average.

# Data

Some of the models and methods used to produce statistics and visualizations in this report will undergo ongoing development as we seek to improve the accuracy of current estimates, incorporate historical observations from other organizations, and add new variables to our annual observations. The development of our annual observations data, code, and analyses can be observed and contributed to from our code and data repository at https://github.com/HakaiInstitute/jsp-time-series. Summarized data can be observed in the tables below or accessed digitally at the web-address mentioned above and utilized under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (CC-BY 4.0). The R code written to produce the figures and statistics in this report can be accessed in our repository and used to reproduce, contribute to, or alter this analysis. An interactive data explorer tool for this developing time series can be accessed online at http://hecate.hakai.org/shiny/JSP/.

# Tables


```{r migration-timing-table}
migration_timing$Species <- factor(migration_timing$Species) %>% 
  fct_relevel("SO", "PI", "CU") %>% 
  fct_recode("Sockeye" = "SO", "Pink" = "PI", "Chum" = "CU")

migration_timing <- migration_timing %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  filter(Year %in% c(paste("2015", "-", current_year), current_year))
knitr::kable(migration_timing, format = 'markdown')
```
Table: (\#tab:migration-timing-table) Migration timing statistics for the cumulative catch of sockeye, pink, and chum salmon in the Discovery Islands in 2019, compared to the time-series average (2015 - `r current_year`). Q1 is when 25 % of the species passed through the regions, peak date is the median when 50 % passed through, Q3 is 75%, and Spread is the difference between Peak Date and Q1. The region DI indicates the Discovery Islands while for species SO is sockeye, PI is pink, and CU is chum. 

```{r length-table}
summary_lengths$species <- factor(summary_lengths$species) %>% 
  fct_relevel("SO", "PI", "CU") %>% 
  fct_recode("Sockeye" = "SO", "Pink" = "PI", "Chum" = "CU")
summary_lengths <- summary_lengths %>% 
  select(Year = year, Species = species, N = n, "Fork Length" = fork_length, CI = CI)
knitr::kable(summary_lengths, format = 'markdown')
```
Table: (\#tab:length-table) Mean fork lengths for each year, species, and region with the +/- 95 % confidence interval (95% CI). The column n indicates the number of fish measured.
