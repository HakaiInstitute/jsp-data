abstract = {Trawl studies from 1998 to 2009 indicated that juvenile Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus spp. and Pacific herring Clupea pallasii represented 98{\%} of the fish in the surface waters of the Strait of Georgia during the day in the spring and early summer. Standardized catches of all juvenile Pacific salmon in the trawl surveys were lowest in 2007. Catches of young-of-the-year Pacific herring were also extremely low in 2007. Three years later, the 2007 year-class had the lowest recruitment to the fishery in recorded history. In 2007, juvenile coho salmon O. kisutch and Chinook salmon O. tshawytscha were small and had the lowest condition of the fish in all surveys as well as a high percentage of empty stomachs. The early marine survival of coho salmon in 2007 and the total survival in 2008 were exceptionally poor. Trawl catches of juvenile chum salmon O. keta in 2007 were the lowest of all surveys. Adult chum salmon from these juveniles that returned in 2010 had extremely poor survival. Juvenile sockeye salmon O. nerka that entered the Strait of Georgia in the spring of 2007 and returned to the Fraser River as adults in 2009 also had such exceptionally poor marine survival that a judicial inquiry was conducted to determine the causes. The synchronous poor growth, survival, or both of all of themajor species in the surface waters of the Strait ofGeorgia in the spring of 2007 indicated that there was a common cause which we propose as poor food production. The causes of the high mortality likely represented a unique extreme in the variability of the factors that normally affect the survival of juvenile Pacific salmon and Pacific herring in the early marine period in the Strait of Georgia.},

Beach seine data were analyzed for sea lice infestation that was described in terms of prevalence, abundance, intensity, and intensity per unit length. The median annual prevalence for chum was 30{\%}, ranging from 14{\%} (in 2008 and 2009) to 73{\%} (in 2004), while for pink salmon, the median was 27{\%} and ranged from 10{\%} (in 2011) to 68{\%} (in 2004). Annual abundance varied from 0.2 to 5 sea lice per fish with a median of 0.47 for chum and from 0.1 to 3 lice (median 0.42) for pink salmon. Annual infestation followed broadly similar trends for both chum and pink salmon. However, the abundance and intensity of Lepeophtheirus salmonis and Caligus clemensi, the 2 main sea lice species of interest, were significantly greater on chum than on pink salmon in around half of the years studied. Logistic regression with random effect was used to model prevalence of sea lice infestation for the combined beach and purse seine data. The model suggested inter-annual variation as well as a spatial clustering effect on the prevalence of sea lice infestation in both chum and pink salmon. Fish length had an effect on prevalence, although the nature of this effect differed according to host species.},

abstract = {Many stocks of Pacifi c salmon enter into and transit through the Strait of Georgia during their migration to off shore waters. Knowledge of the duration of juvenile sockeye salmon residency in the Strait of Georgia and when they migrate out of the strait is essential to understand both natural and anthropogenic factors that may be regulating their early marine survival. We present results from the fi rst year of a multi-year integrated study that demonstrates stock-specifi c diff erences in the migration timing of juvenile Fraser River sockeye salmon over the fi rst eight to 12 weeks of their marine life. The geography of the study region provides a unique opportunity to sample virtually the entire population as they migrate down the Fraser River and as they leave the Strait of Georgia through the Discovery Islands and lower Johnstone Strait. This analysis indicated that juvenile 1-year-old sockeye salmon were resident in the Strait of Georgia for seven to eight weeks in 2014. The catch rates in the Discovery Islands indicated that, in 2014, the peak migration period for Fraser River sockeye salmon occurred over approximately two weeks, with about 80{\%} of all sockeye salmon caught between June 12 and June 19. The results suggest that the Strait of Georgia and the Discovery Islands/Johnstone Strait regions function in a similar manner as the nursery lakes and main river ways in the Fraser River watershed. The Strait of Georgia provides abundant food in a relatively protected habitat similar to their rearing lakes in the watershed. The Discovery Islands and Johnstone Strait, an area of lower food availability, is similar to the river, where fi sh move in concentrated numbers through high current fl ow areas over a relatively short period of time.},

Chum dominated the catches and peaked in abundance in late June, as did pinks. It is probable that the majority of the chum were from the Fraser system. Chinook and coho were less abundant and were primarily fish from Quinsam hatchery. Steelhead and sockeye were uncommon. Length frequency data are given for fish subsampled from the trawls. Judging from data obtained in June 1983, most of the chum migrating to sea from the northern Strait of Georgia use Discovery Passage. If stock composition were determined, Discovery Passage could be a useful monitoring location for migrating juvenile salmonids.},

abstract = {RACT Fisheries and Oceans Canada is responsible for the management and protection of marine resources on the Pacific coast of Canada. Oceanographically this area is a transition zone between coastal upwelling (California Current) and downwelling (Alaskan Coastal Current) regions. There is strong seasonality and considerable freshwater influence, and an added variability from coupling with events and conditions in the tropical and North Pacific Ocean. The region supports ecologically and economically important resident and migratory populations of invertebrates, groundfish, pelagic fishes, marine mammals and seabirds. Since 1999 an annual State of the Pacific Ocean meeting has been held by DFO scientists in the Pacific Region to present the results of the most recent year's monitoring in the context of previous observations and expected future conditions. The workshop to review ecosystem conditions in 2017 was held March 7-8, 2018 at the Vancouver Island Conference Centre in Nanaimo, B.C. This technical report includes submissions based on presentations given at the meeting. The warm surface ocean temperatures along the B.C. coast observed over the past few years have returned to levels consistent with the average conditions recorded in the standard climatology period 1981 to 2010. The upwelling of cool, nutrient rich water along the west coast of Vancouver Island started later than usual in 2017, and was not as intense as previous years, but conditions were still favourable for productivity and fish growth. Non-toxic coccolithophorid algal blooms occurred again in 2017 but not to the same extent as in 2016. There was a high occurrence of gelatinous pyrosomes and salps along the entire B.C. coast in 2017. As predicted the warm ocean conditions in 2015-2016 were unfavourable for the survival of B.C.'s central to south coast salmon. There was a coast-wide synchronous decline of Sockeye Salmon indicator stock returns in 2017. A special session focused on the work being undertaken on Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). Several experts from a variety of government groups in Canada provided overviews of ongoing research in MPAs. An expert from DFO's Maritimes Region provided an overview of the State of the Atlantic Ocean report and how habitat and MPA information were incorporated into that National Ecosystem Reporting process.},

abstract = {The majority of out-migrating juvenile Fraser River salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) pass northwest through the Strait of Georgia, the Discovery Islands, and Johnstone Strait. The Discovery Islands to Johnstone Strait leg of the migration is a region of poor survival for sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) relative to the Strait of Georgia. High resolution spatiotemporal measurements of migration timing and abundance of juvenile sockeye salmon and the relative species composition of co-migrating juvenile salmon are needed to understand the factors influencing early marine survival through this region. Here we report on migration dynamics in the Discovery Islands to Johnstone Strait region based on purse seine data collected by the Hakai Institute Juvenile Salmon Program from 2015–2017. The peak migration period in the Discovery Islands in which 50 {\%} of sockeye passed through occurred between May 25 and June 4 and in Johnstone Strait between May 30 and June 12. Peak abundance was observed earlier than normal in 2015 and 2016, likely due to anomalously warm winter and spring weather. Sockeye migrated at 2.0 BL•s-1 between the Discovery Islands and Johnstone Strait based on the peak migration date in each region, faster than the 1.1 BL•s-1 observed in the Strait of Georgia. Sockeye abundance was much lower in 2017 compared to 2015 and 2016. Species composition was dominated by sockeye in 2015 and 2016, and by chum (Oncorhynchus keta) in 2017.},

abstract = {Pink salmon were sampled at various stages, as fry and fingerling in enclosed waters, as juveniles and subadults in the ocean and as maturing salmon in the commercial fishery. On the basis of length frequency data and from recapture measurements of marked and tagged individuals the instantaneous growth rate in length (g) for successive 30-day periods was computed, As a result three major growth stanzas were recognized. Following the entrance of fry into the estu- ary, growth was approximately exponential (gl : 0.559) during an initial 40-day period. Fish increased in length from 3.5 to 8.4 cm. Thereafter, the instantaneous rate of growth gradually declined to a minimum in March (gl : 0.076). During this time the length increased from 8.4 to 32.5 cm. The final growth period was marked by a rapid rate of increase in length in late For personal use only. April and early May (n : 0.171), followed by a declining rate of increase in length which was finally terminated after the fish had re-entered the coastal waters and the commercial fishery (gl : 0.041). The length data were transformed to weight data fromageneralizedtength-weight regression. During the initial 30-day period the instantaneous growth rate in weight, gw : 6.53. From a value of gw : 2.87 for late May and early June the instantaneous growth rate progressively fell to a low of g, : 1.28 for late March to early April. During late April to early May of the ultimate year, gu : 1.74. The instantaneous growth rate then fell to g, : 1.14 during mid July to early August. It was concluded that growth, in length and weight, of central British Columbia pink salmon is a continuing process with no period of complete cessation from the time the fry enter the sea until the time they re-enter the estuary as adults.},

@article{Mckinnell2014,
abstract = {In spite of a relatively optimistic pre-season forecast, the total return of adult sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) to the Fraser River (British Columbia, Canada) in 2009 was the lowest recorded since quantitative records began in the late 1940s. A plausible mechanism is proposed that links a sequence of extreme oceanic and climatic events to poor marine survival. It began with record-setting snow packs in the coastal mountain range during the winter of 2007 that led to the development of unprecedented oceanographic conditions in the spring of 2007 from Queen Charlotte Strait in central British Columbia to Southeast Alaska. When combined with equally extreme atmospheric anomalies in the region in the spring of 2007, with a winter wind regime persisting through July, a coastal surface ocean with characteristics that are known to be associated with lower marine survival was established. Most of the sockeye salmon that were expected to return to the Fraser River as adults in 2009 passed through this atypical ocean as juveniles on their migration to the open ocean in 2007. A trophic gauntlet hypothesis is proposed as a new paradigm to describe the oceanic environment faced by sockeye salmon after they emigrate northward from the Strait of Georgia. The hypothesis identifies a new type of high nutrient low chlorophyll region that can explain how oceanographic extremes at critical locations along the migration route beyond the Strait of Georgia can reduce marine survival in some years.},
