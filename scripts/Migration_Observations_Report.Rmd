title: Juvenile Salmon Migration Observations in the Discovery Islands and Johnstone Strait in 2019
abstract: >
  The Hakai Institute Juvenile Salmon Program has been monitoring juvenile salmon migrations in the Discovery Islands and Johnstone Strait since 2015 with the specific purpose to understand how ocean conditions experienced by juvenile salmon during their early marine migration impacts their growth, health and ultimately survival. We found that during the two of the warmest years of sea-surface temperature recorded in British Columbia waters, juvenile sockeye, pink, and chum left the Strait of Georgia one to two weeks earlier than previously. The temporal distribution of sockeye migration timing out of the Strait of Georgia north through the Discovery Islands was skewed right, indicating that many sockeye migrate together in late May and abundance tails off late into June and July. Pink and chum migrations are more protracted, lasting from early May to late July. Our results indicate that juvenile sockeye exit the Strait of Georgia en masse, likely in response to ocean temperature and foraging conditions. This report summarizes migration timing, fish length and weight, sea-louse loads, purse seine catch composition, and ocean temperatures observed from the first four years of this research and monitoring program. Combining key variables from this research program with observations from freshwater and high-seas sampling will provide, for some stocks, a complete account of the conditions salmon experience during their migration from their natal river to the high seas. These measures will further our knowledge of what drives early marine mortality, and better our understanding of how salmon are adapting to climate change.

# Results

The peak migration date for sockeye in the Discovery Islands in `r current_year` was on `r f(so_q2_DI_current)`, `r round(so_timing_diff)` days `r so_later_or_earlier` than the study-period average of `r f(so_q2_DI_TSA)`. The peak migration date for chum in the Discovery Islands was on `r f(cu_q2_DI_current)`, `r round(cu_timing_diff)` days `r cu_later_or_earlier` than the average of `r f(cu_q2_DI_TSA)`. Peak migration timing for pink salmon is not reported because we expect catches of juvenile pink salmon do not originate from the Fraser River in odd years.

Catch proportion was dominated by sockeye salmon in the Discovery Islands and Johnstone in `r current_year` making up `r so_prop` % of the catch (Table \@ref(tab:proportion-table)) while chum made up `r cu_prop` % and pink `r pi_prop` % (Figure \@ref(fig:proportion-plot)). 

Fish lengths varied between regions and among species and years (Figure \@ref(fig:length-plot)) though in `r current_year` sockeye were `r ifelse(len_tt[1,2] > 0, "longer", "shorter")`, pink were `r ifelse(len_tt[2,2] > 0, "longer", "shorter")`, and chum were `r ifelse(len_tt[3,2] > 0, "longer", "shorter")` than their respective study-period averages in the Discovery Islands and Johnstone Strait combined. Sockeye length was `r round(len_tt[1,3],1)` mm (Table \@ref(tab:length-table)), which is `r abs(round(len_tt[1,2],1))` mm `r ifelse(len_tt[1,2] > 0, "longer", "shorter")` than the study-period average (_p_ < 0.0001, 95% CI `r abs(round(len_tt[1,8],1))` -`r abs(round(len_tt[1,9],1))`). Average pink lengths were `r round(len_tt[2,3],1)` mm, which is `r abs(round(len_tt[2,2],1))` mm `r ifelse(len_tt[2,2] > 0, "longer", "shorter")` than the study-period average (_p_ < 0.0001, 95% CI `r abs(round(len_tt[2,8],1))`-`r abs(round(len_tt[2,9],1))`). Chum  were on average `r round(len_tt[3,3],1)` mm, which is `r abs(round(len_tt[3,2],1))` mm  `r ifelse(len_tt[3,2] > 0, "longer", "shorter")` than the study-period average (_p_ < 0.0001, 95% CI `r abs(round(len_tt[3,8],1))`-`r round(len_tt[3,9],1)`).

Sea-surface temperature in May and June during the juvenile salmon out-migration at QU39 in the northern Strait of Georgia was `r round(sst_stats_table$estimate, 2)` degrees C different than average.

# Data

Some of the models and methods used to produce statistics and visualizations in this report will undergo ongoing development as we seek to improve the accuracy of current estimates, incorporate historical observations from other organizations, and add new variables to our annual observations. The development of our annual observations data, code, and analyses can be observed and contributed to from our code and data repository at https://github.com/HakaiInstitute/jsp-time-series. Summarized data can be observed in the tables below or accessed digitally at the web-address mentioned above and utilized under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (CC-BY 4.0). The R code written to produce the figures and statistics in this report can be accessed in our repository and used to reproduce, contribute to, or alter this analysis. An interactive data explorer tool for this developing time series can be accessed online at http://hecate.hakai.org/shiny/JSP/.

# Tables

```{r z-scores-table}
heatmap_data <- heatmap_data %>% 
  select(spp, year, measure, Estimate, SD, Z)
knitr::kable(heatmap_data, col.names = c("Species", "Year","Parameter", "Estimate", "SD", "Z score"), format = 'markdown')
```
Table: (\#tab:z-scores-table) Key salmon health, growth, and migration annual estimates. Migration timing estimates are the median capture date in the Discovery Islands, catch intensity estimates are the mean catch when greater than one sockeye are caught in the Discovery Islands and Johnstone Strait combined, length estimates are the mean fork length (mm) in both regions combined, parasite loads are mean abundance for motile lice from both regions combined, and SST is the mean sea-surface temperature in degrees celcius at station QU39 in the northern Strait of Georgia. Standard deviation is denoted by SD and is the within-year standard deviation (note no SD for median capture dates). Z score is the number of standard deviations the annual estimate is away from the study period mean.


```{r migration-timing-table}
migration_timing$Species <- factor(migration_timing$Species) %>% 
  fct_relevel("SO", "PI", "CU") %>% 
  fct_recode("Sockeye" = "SO", "Pink" = "PI", "Chum" = "CU")

migration_timing <- migration_timing %>% 
  drop_na()
knitr::kable(migration_timing, format = 'markdown')
```
Table: (\#tab:migration-timing-table) Migration timing statistics for the cumulative catch of sockeye, pink, and chum salmon in the Discovery Islands in 2019, compared to the time-series average (2015 - `r current_year`). Q1 is when 25 % of the species passed through the regions, peak date is the median when 50 % passed through, Q3 is 75%, and Spread is the difference between Peak Date and Q1. The region DI indicates the Discovery Islands while for species SO is sockeye, PI is pink, and CU is chum. 

```{r catch-intensity-table}
catch_intensity <- catch_intensity %>% 
  select("year", "species", "mean_catch")

knitr::kable(catch_intensity, format = 'markdown', 
             col.names = c("Year", "Species", "Catch Intensity"))
```
Table: (\#tab:catch-intensity-table) Catch intensity—our proxy for abundance—for sockeye, pink, and chum in the Discovery Islands and Johnstone Strait combined.


```{r length-table}
summary_lengths$species <- factor(summary_lengths$species) %>% 
  fct_relevel("SO", "PI", "CU") %>% 
  fct_recode("Sockeye" = "SO", "Pink" = "PI", "Chum" = "CU")
summary_lengths <- summary_lengths %>% 
  select(Year = year, Region = region, Species = species, N = n, "Fork Length" = fork_length, CI = CI)
knitr::kable(summary_lengths, format = 'markdown')
```
Table: (\#tab:length-table) Mean fork lengths for each year, species, and region with the 95 % confidence interval (95% CI). The column n indicates the number of fish measured.


```{r proportion-table}
knitr::kable(proportions_table, format = 'markdown')
```
Table: (\#tab:proportion-table) The species proportions of total catch in each year for sockeye, pink, chum, herring, coho, and Chinook.

```{r sealice-table}

  mutate_if(is.numeric, round, 2)

kable(df, format = 'markdown', caption = "Mean sea-lice abundance (with 95% CI) from annual averages) ")


```
Table: (\#tab:sealice-table) Mean sea-louse abundance, prevalence, and intensity (as defined in Margolis et al. 1990) across the study period (2015-`r current_year`) for each fish, region, and year. 95% confidence intervals were calculated from annual averages. The region DI indicates the Discovery Islands and JS Johnstone Strait.
